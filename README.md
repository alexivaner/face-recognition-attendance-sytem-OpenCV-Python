# Face Recognition Attendance System - OpenCV - Python
 This is prototype of Face Recognition for attendance system.<br>
 The project made as the requirement of Intelligence Computational Algorithm courses in NCTU.<br>

 ## Model
This project is using Open Face Model and Support Vector Machine<br>
You can download the open face model [here](https://storage.cmusatyalab.org/openface-models/nn4.small2.v1.t7) and put into open-face-cv folder<br> and download the face detection model [here](https://github.com/thegopieffect/computer_vision/blob/master/CAFFE_DNN/res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel) and put into open-face-cv/face_detection_model folder

## OpenCV Installation and Face Recognition Tutorial
We modified this face recognition code from pyimagesearch to satisfied our requirement in this case we want to use for attendance system. The explanation about face recognition and installation could be read [here](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/09/24/opencv-face-recognition/), pyimagesearch has very good explanation and implementation about computer vision.
